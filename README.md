This is an express JS app which allows you to find a friend that best match your responses.
To run this, save all the files, install npm (npm i) and run the file in the terminal ( node server.js). Make sure you are in current path while running as well as installing npm packages.
After you run the server.js file and there is connection, open http://localhost:8080 on browser.
